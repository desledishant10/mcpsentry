"""Calibration corpus regression check.

These tests assert that the current state of the corpus + classifier
hits the "stable" threshold defined in docs/capability-classifier.md:

  - At least 10 labeled targets
  - Precision >= 0.90 on every exercised capability tag
  - Recall >= 0.75 on every exercised capability tag
  - Parameter-role accuracy >= 0.80

These are spec-floor assertions, not aspirational ones. The current
observed state (2026-06-11) is 100% precision and 100% recall across
6 exercised tags on 11 targets, with 90% param-role accuracy. The
floor is set at the spec's published threshold so a regression has
to be material before CI trips.

If you tune a rule and this test fails, you've dropped below the spec.
Either revert the tuning, or update the spec and update these tests in
the same commit.
