Hi $recipient,

Quick follow-up on the coordinated security disclosure I sent on

reached you — sometimes security mail ends up in spam.

Affected: $affected
Embargo: $embargo

Happy to coordinate timeline or discuss the suggested fix shape on
any channel that works for you. No urgency; just confirming visibility.

Second follow-up on the disclosure sent $filed_date (day +$day today).

again in case the earlier mail was filtered.

Hi $recipient,

Day +$day from the original disclosure today. The email channel has

escalating to other channels in parallel — see options below.

Affected: $affected
Embargo: $embargo
Record: https://github.com/desledishant10/mcp-witness/blob/main/disclosures/$slug.md

If I haven't heard back by day +45, I'll file a non-exploitative
pointer issue on the upstream repo so the issue thread reflects an
active disclosure (no PoC details in that issue; full disclosure
stays embargoed until $embargo).

Soft channels I'll try in parallel today (in order of preference):
1. LinkedIn DM (lowest-friction)
2. Twitter / Bluesky DM if available
3. Contact form on the project site if one exists
4. This third email on the thread

If any of those reach you first, just reply on whichever channel.

Awaiting acknowledgement on coordinated security disclosure sent $filed_date

Filing this as a non-exploitative pointer since the private channels
have been silent for 45 days.

A coordinated security disclosure covering $affected was sent on
$filed_date. Day +14, +21, and +30 follow-ups received no response.
Day +30 escalation attempts via soft channels (LinkedIn / contact
form / additional email) also received no response.

**No exploit details in this issue.** The full disclosure record
(suggested fix, file references, embargo timeline) is at
https://github.com/desledishant10/mcp-witness/blob/main/disclosures/$slug.md
and remains under embargo until $embargo.

Please reply on this issue or directly on the original email thread
if any of the prior messages reached you. Happy to switch to any
private channel you prefer.

Embargo expires $embargo. Per the coordinated-disclosure policy
