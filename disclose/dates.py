"""Day-count + milestone arithmetic for the disclosure track.

Milestone cadence is the one used in the mcp-witness disclosure record itself:
+14 / +21 / +30 / +45 / +60 / +90. Each milestone has a recommended action.
The cadence is encoded as data so callers can iterate or modify without
having to touch the rest of the codebase.
