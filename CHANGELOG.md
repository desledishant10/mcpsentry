# Changelog

All notable changes to mcpsentry (formerly MCP-Scan; renamed 2026-06-08 to avoid namespace collision with Snyk-Invariant's `mcp-scan` / `agent-scan`). Format roughly follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/); the project is alpha so changes are not yet versioned with semver discipline. Historical version sections below preserve the project's original name as written at release time.

## [Unreleased] — main branch

### Changed

- **Project renamed: MCP-Scan → mcpsentry.** Avoids collision with Snyk-Invariant's well-established `mcp-scan` (now `agent-scan`, 2.5k stars). PyPI namespace, GitHub repo URL, console scripts, and project-name prose updated; package directories (`analyzer/`, `harness/`, `classifier/`, `calibration/`) keep their functional names. Historical CHANGELOG sections and disclosure records preserve the original name as written at release / send time — only currently-canonical surfaces (README, pyproject, package docs, in-code CLI help) are updated.
- **Console scripts renamed:** `mcp-scan-*` → `mcpsentry-*` (audit, capture, scaffold-gt, analyze, classify, eval-calibration, lint-scenarios, test). Reinstall after pulling: `pip uninstall mcp-scan -y && pip install -e ".[dev]"`.
- **README rewritten** to lead with the Anthropic SSRF disclosure narrative (EC2 IAM-credential demo + PR #4226 verified) before test counts / rule tables. The disclosure is the differentiator; test counts are table stakes.
- **GitHub Pages enabled** at `desledishant10.github.io/mcpsentry`. `_config.yml` excludes `drafts/`, `disclosures/`, `findings/`, source dirs, etc. — only the root README and `docs/` are published as Pages-served HTML.
- **Embargoed blog draft moved out of `/docs/`** to `/drafts/` to keep it out of Pages indexing pre-2026-08-10. Still in the public repo (open-auditing principle preserved), just not in the Pages-served path.

### Fixed

- **`_walk_repo_files` substring-on-absolute-path bug.** The skip-fragment check (e.g. `/site-packages/`, `/.venv/`) was matched against the absolute path, which meant *any* scan rooted under `site-packages/` returned zero files. This silently broke `mcp-scan-audit <pypi-pkg>` for the entire v0.2 lifecycle — the documented quickstart workflow. Surfaced by re-running the v0.3 detector against the original DNS-rebind survey targets and getting zero hits despite the patches being correct. The walker now checks skip fragments against the path *relative* to root, so user-pointed-at scans inside one of the skip dirs work correctly.

### Changed

- **MCP-S-014 detector v0.3 patches.** The DNS-rebinding survey surfaced three false-negative classes in the v0.2 detector; all are now fixed, plus a fourth (W4) surfaced during the post-patch verification re-run:
  - **W1 — host=variable resolution.** The detector previously only resolved string-literal host arguments. `uvicorn.run(app, host=host, port=port)` patterns where `host` is bound to `"0.0.0.0"` earlier (via module-level assignment or function parameter default) now resolve correctly. Pre-pass `_collect_string_bindings(tree)` walks the file for `ast.Assign` and `FunctionDef.args.defaults` / `kwonlyargs` bindings; `_extract_host_value` threads the binding map through and resolves `ast.Name` arguments. File-wide flat scope (no lexical-scope precision) is a deliberate heuristic for a "review this" static rule.
  - **W2 — origin-suppression tightened.** Previously a case-insensitive `\borigin\b` substring match anywhere in the file silenced the rule. Comments like `# CORS handled by Traefik` and wildcard CORS response headers (`Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`) both qualified. New `_file_validates_origin(tree)` walks the AST for actual request-header reads: `.headers["Origin"]` (subscript) or `.headers.get("Origin", …)` (method call), case-insensitive on the key. Comments, docstrings, and response-header string literals no longer suppress.
  - **W3 — aiohttp.web bind shapes.** `_SERVER_BIND_METHODS` extended with `run_app` (keyword-host pattern: `web.run_app(app, host="…")`) and `TCPSite` (positional-host pattern: `web.TCPSite(runner, "…", port)`). `mcp-server-fetch-sse` and similar aiohttp-based packages no longer slip through the detector.
  - **W4 — `os.getenv(..., "default")` and `os.environ.get(..., "default")` resolution.** Surfaced during the post-patch verification against `mcp-fetch-streamablehttp-server`, which uses `host = os.getenv("HOST", "0.0.0.0")` — the env-driven default pattern. `_extract_env_default` resolves the second-arg string default; `_collect_string_bindings` calls it for `Assign` nodes whose value is a `Call`. Now binds `name → "default"` for both `os.getenv` and `os.environ.get` shapes.
- **Verified end-to-end against the original DNS-rebind survey targets.** Re-ran the v0.3 detector on all four installed packages (after fixing the walker bug above). 4 of 4 now correctly fire S-014: `mcp-streamablehttp-proxy` (W1), `mcp-fetch-streamablehttp-server` (W4), `fastmcp-http` (W1), and `mcp-server-fetch-sse` (W1+W3).
- Test suite: **151 → 164** tests (13 new across W1/W2/W3/W4 positive + negative cases).

### Disclosure status

- **2026-06-02 — Three new disclosures dispatched.**
  - `fastmcp-http` v0.1.4 DNS rebinding: public-issue channel of last resort at [ARadRareness/mcp-registry#3](https://github.com/ARadRareness/mcp-registry/issues/3) after `gh api` verified GHSA disabled + maintainer profile has no contact + PyPI lists only a GitHub-noreply email. Public issue body intentionally light on PoC; embargo principle held by keeping source-line evidence in the private finding only.
  - `mcp-server-fetch-sse` v0.1.1 DNS rebinding + inherited pre-PR-#4226 SSRF: primary disclosure to maintainer-of-record `jadamson@anthropic.com`; parallel courtesy notice to Anthropic Security via `disclosure@anthropic.com` after HackerOne attempt halted at the program triage interstitial (full channel-decision audit trail in [disclosures/2026-06-02-mcp-server-fetch-sse-dns-rebinding.md](disclosures/2026-06-02-mcp-server-fetch-sse-dns-rebinding.md)). `disclosure@` returned a no-reply auto-responder routing back to HackerOne — no human review reached on the brand-attribution flag. Documented; primary technical disclosure to maintainer is the binding channel for the fix.
  - Day +21 follow-up pings sent on the two May 12 disclosures that remained silent (statespace `mcp-server-http-request`, atrawog `mcp-streamablehttp-proxy` + `mcp-fetch-streamablehttp-server`).
- **All six DNS-rebind + SSRF survey targets are now under active coordinated disclosure with the same 2026-08-10 embargo** for the class-wide public writeup.

### Disclosure status (earlier)

- **2026-05-22 — mcp-server-fetch fix PR opened AND independently verified.** PR [modelcontextprotocol/servers#4226](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/pull/4226) by `@kgarg2468` explicitly fixes [#4143](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/issues/4143) with scheme allowlist + reserved-range denylist + **per-redirect validation** (a defense beyond the original disclosure ask). Same demo script that retrieved IAM credentials on EC2 was re-run against the fix branch: now returns `"Fetching private or non-public IP addresses is not allowed"`. Verification comment posted on the PR. Awaiting maintainer approval.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-05-12

### Added

- **Static-analyzer ruleset complete: 14/14 v0.1 rules implemented.** Five new rules close out the spec:
  - **MCP-S-010** — committed secrets and `.env` files. Regex scan for named-format keys (AWS, GitHub, OpenAI, Anthropic, Stripe, Slack, Google API, PEM private keys, JWTs); flag presence of `.env*` files in source tree (excluding documented-safe `.example` / `.sample` / `.template` / `.dist` variants). Path-glob allowlist via `.mcp-scan-allowlist` at scan root.
  - **MCP-S-011** — sensitive data logged to stderr/stdout. AST scan over tool handlers for `print`, `logging.X`, `logger.X`, `sys.stderr.write`, `console.error` calls whose arguments reference a tool parameter, a sensitive-named identifier (`token`, `password`, `header`, etc.), or `os.environ`/`os.getenv`. Calls inside `if debug:` / `if verbose:` blocks suppressed as the documented opt-in shape.
  - **MCP-S-012** — `RootsCapability` referenced but `list_roots()` never called. Cross-file scan; declares a containment guarantee the server doesn't actually enforce.
  - **MCP-S-013** — prompt template interpolation without sanitization. Discovers `@<x>.prompt()` handlers, inspects `PromptMessage`/`Message`/role-typed constructors and dict-literal messages, flags parameter interpolation (f-string, `.format`, `%`-format, `+`-concat) into `system` or `assistant` roles. User-role interpolation silenced — too conventional to be useful signal.
  - **MCP-S-014** — HTTP transport missing Origin/Host validation. AST scan for `uvicorn.run` / similar server binds on `0.0.0.0` / `127.0.0.1` / `localhost`; flags when the source file contains no reference to `Origin` header validation. Also flags the CORS `allow_origins=['*']` + `allow_credentials=True` antipattern.
- **`REPO_RULES` rule shape** — new third rule registry alongside `RULES` (per-tool) and `SERVER_RULES` (per tool set). Rules in this shape receive the scan-root `Path` and walk the source tree themselves. Used by S-010, S-012, S-013, S-014. Captured-mode scans (`.json`) skip `REPO_RULES` since there's no source tree.
- `mcp-scan-audit` — one-shot CLI that pip-installs a package, captures its tools/list, runs the analyzer and classifier, and prints a human-readable report. Replaces the previous three-command quickstart in the README.
- Analyzer rule **MCP-S-004** — flags tools whose `annotations.readOnlyHint: true` or `destructiveHint: false` contradicts write-indicating verbs in the name or description.
- Analyzer rule **MCP-S-008** — heuristic SQLi detection from captured `tools/list`; flags query-typed parameters without parameterized-query mention.
- Analyzer rule **MCP-S-009** — heuristic SSRF detection from captured `tools/list`; static counterpart to the dynamic MCP-D-003 probe. Fires on `mcp-server-fetch` and `mcp-server-http-request`.
- Dynamic scenario **MCP-D-007** — cloud-metadata-exfiltration scenario with strict oracle (only fires on JSON-shape metadata field names; designed for EC2 audit verification).
- `disclosures/` directory with append-only audit-trail records of outgoing coordinated-disclosure communications. First entry covers the fetch + http-request SSRF disclosure.
- `findings/` directory entries for: D-003 SSRF on mcp-server-fetch (vulnerability, demonstrated on EC2 + disclosed as [modelcontextprotocol/servers#4143](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/issues/4143)); D-003 SSRF on mcp-server-http-request (vulnerability, email-disclosed); D-001/D-006 defense observations against Claude Opus 4.7; D-002 defense observations against mcp-server-git and mcp-server-aidd; S-003 informational on mcp-server-time; aidd multi-rule informational.
- `docs/audit-runbook-ec2-ssrf-verification.md` — step-by-step runbook from AWS account creation through EC2 reproduction, evidence capture, and teardown.
- `docs/blog-draft-2026-08-10-mcp-ssrf-disclosure.md` — embargo-day blog draft (publication scheduled for 2026-08-10).
- `SECURITY.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
- Calibration corpus growth: 5 → 10 labeled targets, 33 → 81 tools. Stable per spec.
- Calibration-driven lexicon improvements (each commit-annotated with the corpus evidence that drove it).
- Test suite: 76 → **151** tests (45 new across the five new rules).

### Changed

- README rewritten to feature real findings + one-command quickstart instead of planning-document framing.
- Scaffolded ground-truth files now include `labeled: false` so the eval skips drafts by default.
- `_relpath` normalization (in `analyzer/rules.py`) made consistent between directory and single-file scans — REPO_RULES findings now report the same path form as per-tool findings.

### Fixed

- `\blists?\b` lexicon pattern false-positive on Python type annotations (`Optional[List[str]] - Tags`); now uses `(?<!\[)\blists?\b(?![\[\(])` to exclude generic-type contexts.
- D-002 scenario YAML had an embedded null byte (`%00` escape-sequence smuggling); replaced with literal `%00` characters.

### Security

- Coordinated disclosure filed for class-wide SSRF in `mcp-server-fetch` (Anthropic reference) and `mcp-server-http-request` (community). Embargo expires 2026-08-10.
