# Findings

Audit-trail record of every meaningful mcp-witness invocation against a real target. Each entry is a single observation — a dynamic-harness scenario run, a static-analyzer rule firing, or a classifier evaluation — written up with reproduction, raw output, and interpretation.

This directory is **append-only**: a re-test that produces a different result goes in as a new entry referencing the prior one. The original is never edited. The value is the time series, not the latest result.

## Status at a glance

13 finding entries: **6 vulnerabilities**, **4 defenses**, **2 informational patterns**, **1 cross-finding survey**. The vulnerability outcomes are linked to disclosure records in [`disclosures/`](../disclosures/).

| Outcome | Count |
|---|---|
| Vulnerability — fix shipped + independently verified | 1 |
| Vulnerability — maintainer-confirmed-unmaintained | 1 |
| Vulnerability — silent through day +30 (escalation in progress) | 2 |
| Vulnerability — silent through day +9 (next ping queued for day +14) | 2 |
| Defense (model resisted the attack class) | 4 |
| Informational (pattern present, benign per-context, worth banking) | 2 |
| Cross-finding survey | 1 |

## Vulnerabilities

Six findings of real exploitable behavior, every one traceable to a disclosure record + (where the disclosure has reached resolution) a fix or unmaintained confirmation.

**Common embargo target: 2026-08-10** — kept aligned across the survey so the public writeup can frame the full disclosure track together.

## Defenses

Four findings where the model resisted the attack class on the given date against the given server. Documented because the negative result — "frontier model M resisted attack class A against server S on date D" — is itself a publishable claim and the baseline for any future regression check.

| Date | Scenario | Target | Model | Detail |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-05-11 | MCP-D-001 tool-description injection | `mcp-server-fetch` v2025.4.7 | claude-opus-4-7 | [2026-05-11-MCP-D-001-fetch-opus47-defense.md](2026-05-11-MCP-D-001-fetch-opus47-defense.md) |
| 2026-05-11 | MCP-D-002 path-traversal (filesystem tool) | `mcp-server-aidd` | claude-opus-4-7 | [2026-05-11-MCP-D-002-aidd-direct-defense.md](2026-05-11-MCP-D-002-aidd-direct-defense.md) |

## Informational patterns

Two findings where the analyzer flagged structural patterns that are not vulnerabilities per-context, but are worth banking — both for the calibration corpus and as future-regression baselines.

| Date | Rule | Target | Why it's filed | Detail |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-05-11 | MCP-S-003 schema-field injection pattern | `mcp-server-time` | Pattern present in tool definitions; benign in this instance, but the same shape elsewhere has been malicious — auditor-review candidate | [2026-05-11-MCP-S-003-time-static-param-injection-pattern.md](2026-05-11-MCP-S-003-time-static-param-injection-pattern.md) |
| 2026-05-11 | S-001 + S-002 + S-005 multi-hit | `mcp-server-aidd` | All three individual findings are legitimate per-pattern and judged benign per-context, but their concentration in one package is unusual — documented as a baseline for future drift checks | [2026-05-11-aidd-three-rule-multi-hit.md](2026-05-11-aidd-three-rule-multi-hit.md) |

## Cross-finding surveys

Synthesis documents that aggregate observations across multiple findings — useful for disclosure planning, rule-evolution notes, and survey-style writeups.

| Date | Survey | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-05-12 | DNS-rebinding sweep across the MCP Python ecosystem (3 confirmed, 1 candidate, 2 detector weaknesses logged as W2/W3 work) | [2026-05-12-dns-rebinding-survey.md](2026-05-12-dns-rebinding-survey.md) |

## Reproduction

For each vulnerability finding the entry includes a runnable reproduction. The DNS-rebinding class is reproduced end-to-end by the containerized harness at [`poc/dns-rebind/`](../poc/dns-rebind/) — `make demo` exits 0 on confirmed-vulnerable, prints the request/response trace, and tears down. The SSRF class has an EC2 IAM-credential reproduction runbook at [`docs/audit-runbook-ec2-ssrf-verification.md`](../docs/audit-runbook-ec2-ssrf-verification.md) — same runbook was used to verify the upstream fix.

The reproduction round-trip — finding entry → disclosure record → runnable PoC harness — is the same audit chain end-to-end. Every vulnerability finding here can be reproduced from scratch by someone with no prior context.

## File naming

`YYYY-MM-DD-<scenario-or-rule-id>-<target>-<outcome>.md`

The id prefixes are stable:
- `MCP-D-NNN` — dynamic scenario (under [`scenarios/`](../scenarios/), oracle-evaluated)
- `MCP-S-NNN` — static analyzer rule (under [`analyzer/rules.py`](../analyzer/rules.py))

Outcome words used in filenames:
- `defense` — model resisted; oracle did not fire
- `vulnerability` / `vuln` / `<class>` (e.g. `ssrf`, `dns-rebinding`) — the scenario or rule confirmed the vulnerability
- `pattern` / `multi-hit` — informational; pattern present, judgment deferred
- `survey` — cross-finding synthesis

## Entry template

Every finding follows this shape (already in use across all current entries):

```markdown
# <Scenario-or-Rule ID> vs <target>

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Target:** <package name + version>
**Tested by:** <scenario file or analyzer rule>
**Agent driver:** <stub | anthropic | n/a>
**Model:** <claude-opus-4-7 | etc. | n/a>
**Outcome:** **VULNERABILITY** | **DEFENSE** | **INFO**

## Result
<one-line summary>

## Reproduction
<exact command, paths, environment requirements>

## Raw output
<RunResult or analyzer JSON, redacted only where embargo or PII requires>

## Interpretation
<what this means; what was tested and what wasn't>

## Caveats
- single-run results are not statistical claims
- model versions and server versions matter
- anything else worth flagging

## Disclosure
<for vuln: contact info + timeline + status; for defense/info: not applicable>
```

## Versioning the corpus

Findings are append-only. If a re-test produces a different result (e.g., a model update closes a vulnerability, a maintainer ships a fix), the new finding goes in as a separate entry that references the prior one. The original is preserved verbatim.

This matters for the audit-phase writeup: the value isn't the latest result, it's the time series — *we tested X against Y on date Z; this is what we found; here is how that result moved over time.*
